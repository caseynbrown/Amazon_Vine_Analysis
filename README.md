# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
We reviewed the Amazon reviews for the Wireless category that were written by members of the Vine program, which is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. The purpose of this analysis was to determine if there was any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members. 

## Results
How many vine reviews and non-vine reviews were there?

There were 613 vine reviews and 64,771 non-vine reviews.

## Summary
The number of non-vine reviews was significantly higher than vine reviews, which suggests a bias toward non-vine members. 
I would suggest doing another analysis but not filtering by the total vote count of 20, as that may be slightly high to get an accurate representation. I would suggest filtering on reviews that have at least 5 reviews, and running through the same analysis we did here.
